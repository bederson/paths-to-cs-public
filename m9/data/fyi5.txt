Dr. Lawrence Sherman & Heather Harris

A University of Maryland study has discovered unexpected but lethal effects on domestic assault victims from police arrest of their abusive partners. The effects are not from homicide, but from heart disease and other illnesses associated with post-traumatic stress. The evidence suggests that arrests are traumatic events for victims that cause their 64% higher death rate from all causes compared to victims whose partners are merely warned by police and left at the scene.
