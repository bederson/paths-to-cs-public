Where         : Cole Student Activities Building : 0124B
Event Type(s) : Seminar

Speaker: Alexandra Killewald, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology, Harvard University

About the Talk: Studies based on single-sex models document a substantial motherhood wage penalty and a smaller fatherhood premium. These results tell us little about how the labor costs of parenthood operate within couples -- a crucial limitation given that most American children are born to couples. Specialization theory suggests that spouses are making tradeoffs, with highly-specialized couples receiving both a large motherhood penalty and a large fatherhood premium and less specialized couples experiencing smaller changes for each spouse.  Overall, we find little evidence that the fatherhood premium for contemporary American men comes at the expense of the motherhood penalty.

Speaker: Simon DiMaio, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

One by one, Medical robots are crossing the chasm that lies between laboratory bench-top prototypes and commercial products. Next-generation surgical systems are now on the horizon and the research community is already contemplating fantastic new technologies that will extend computer-assisted surgery even further.

In this talk, we will take a step back together to look at the origins of the da Vinci telerobotic system, its present capabilities, and limitations; its acceptance, as well as new technologies on the horizon, and how we might see such platforms evolve in the future. I will talk from the perspective of a researcher embedded in industry and will share some of the challenges that we have experienced in taking research concepts and prototypes toward product.

October is Fair Trade Month and a good time to think about the hard-working people who produce the foods we eat and the fabrics we wear.  Fair Trade is trade in which producers are justly and fairly compensated for their products.  It is a system that respects producers, communities and the environment.  Common Fair Trade products found on campus are coffee, tea and chocolate.  Look for Fair Trade certification on the products you buy or try a new-to-you Fair Trade product during October.

In the aftermath of protest and political change at the national level in Egypt, there has been very little democratic change at the local formal institutional level. One of the key demands of the 2011 uprising was social justice and this talk will analyze the increasingly difficult urban challenges of the mega-city of Cairo, as well as efforts among urbanists and activists to claim their "right to the city." How does an understanding of the bureaucratic edifice of local politics in Egypt, contestation over the built environment, and comparative examples of urban change from other democratic transitions shed light on the Egyptian case?

Subject       : Brown Bag Discussion: Engaging the Community Through Digital Archives: the Lakeland Community Heritage Project
When          : Friday, October 25, 2013 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM
Where         : Patuxent Building; Room 0120
Event Type(s) : Forum

Since 2009, Dr. Mary Corbin Sies has been teaching a community-engaged class in which her students collaborate with the Lakeland Community Heritage Project to help document and archive the history and culture of this historic African American neighborhood, adjacent to our campus, in College Park. The class uses Omeka software (www.omeka.org) to house the digital archive, which includes deeds, newspaper clippings, photographs, oral histories, and videos. This brown bag will showcase the Lakeland archive on Omeka and talk about the benefits and challenges of using Omeka.

This is a great opportunity for instructors to bring their ideas and questions to an open forum where we can discuss and learn from each other.

No registration is required. Light refreshments will be provided. This event is open for all faculty and staff who enjoy participating in a lively discussion.
