In Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous "I Have a Dream" speech, he describes the journey of black people from slavery to the promise of freedom. He said black people were given a "blank check" and the marchers were in Washington to demand payment. He also said that the people would "'.not be satisfied until justice rolled down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream'" Join us at this forum, led by Dr. Stephen Thomas from the UMD School of Public Health and Center for Health Equity, where he will focus on how the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is indeed making good on a portion of that "blank check".

Subject       : Wellness Tip of the Week: Fuel Up Before a Workout
Event Type(s) : Health

Before hitting the gym, trail, pool or anywhere else you like to be active, eat a small snack 1-2 hours before your workout. Eating before physical activity fuels your muscles so you can get the most out of your effort. In general, it's important to pair a carbohydrate with a protein for optimum workout performance. Carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy. This nutrient will be stored in your muscles and give them an extra boost while you're active. Protein, on the other hand, is important for muscle and tissue repair. Eating protein before a workout may also help prevent muscle soreness. Fluids are essential too -- make sure you're drinking plenty of water before, during and after your workout. For nutritious pre-workout snack ideas, visit: http://umwellness.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/what-to-eat-before-a-workout/.

Do you speak Mandarin Chinese, Persian/Farsi, or Russian as a learner? The University of Maryland Center for Advanced Study of Language is recruiting advanced leaners of these languages to participate in a language study. The goal of the project is to identify which aspects of these languages speakers at your proficiency level typically already know, and which aspects they still have difficulty with.

For the study, you will be asked to take several tests looking at your language abilities. All tests will be remotely administered, meaning you can take them at a time and location of your convenience.

For full participation, you will earn $40. Learners will also receive official proficiency scores with a certificate.
